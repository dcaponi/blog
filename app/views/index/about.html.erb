    Defying the norms and experiencing all of what life
    has to offer are what I'm all about. I love exploring topics
    in Mechanical, Aerospace, and Software Engineering. I am a born
    tinkerer who is often found taking stuff apart and building
    cool stuff.

    I like to experience everything the Pacific Northwest has to offer
    and share my adventures in photos and blog posts. I also enjoy
    tinkering with electronics and Arduino boards. In addition, I like
    to play around with Android apps and build web apps in Ruby. the
    internet of things revolution is fascinating and I plan to learn
    how to develop for it as I build on my software development skills.

    I'm a die hard Star Wars fan, I use tabs over spaces and my favorite
    languages include Java, Ruby, and AngularJS. I was a long time Windows
    user who recently converted to Apple, and I am still on the fence absolute
    Android vs IPhone.

  <p>
    Not only do I love learning new things, but I also love sharing
    what I learn in my experiences studies. Every time I learn something
    that I found difficult, I like to share with my followers and friends
    so they too can take advantage of the amazing technologies available
    today.
